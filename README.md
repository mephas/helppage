# Tutorial and Help for MEPHAS

We hope this document can help users get familiar with MEPHAS and understand how to use MEPHAS.
Additionally, we also provide some links which could help users learn more statistics.


We expected MEPHAS to help researchers who have already got the data or known the objectives (even unclear) to conduct statistics. 
MEPHAS could also help students to practice statistical methods, in the statistical lectures
However, for those who do not understand basic statistics, it is hard to start MEPAHS.
